                Paying people to tabulate for you is expensive, slow and hard,
                so why not try the newest tabulation service which uses the
                most cutting edge technology to make tabulation better for
                everyone!

                        Stop paying heaps of money for people to tabulate for you. Instead have our
                        <u>Artificial Intelligence</u> system read the numbers right off the score sheets
                        and tabulate them immediately!

                        is the service for you. With the power and speed of our Artificial Intelligence you
                        can increase your tabulation speeds by around <b>300%</b>

                        We have abstracted all of the hard and tedious parts away from tabulation. This
                        means the feis volunteers in charge of tabulation will simply have to fix some errors
                        made by the Artificial Intelligence system.

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                AutoFeis was made solely by me, Spencer McMurray, a 19-year old
                Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I've
                been dancing since I was 10, but been at feiseanna since I was
                2 thanks to my sister who also dances.
            </p><br />
            <h1>Backstory</h1>
            <p>
                At all of the many feiseanna I've attended, results have always
                taken a long time to arrive. When I was younger I didn't understand
                why, but as I got older I started to see how much effort went
                into tabulation, and I grew much more respect for those who
                tabulate our results.
            </p><br />
            <h1>The Story</h1>
            <p>
                I've had an intrest in Computer Science for a long time, but
                only recently have I delved into the insane topic of Artificial
                Intelligence. It's far too complicated to explain to you in one
                paragraph, but I reccommend you search what goes into modern
                A.I if this intrests you. Anyway, I grew intrested in the idea
                of automating human tasks like driving cars and mastering games.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day I was at a feis and I was curious to see how long it
                would take to tabulate our results. Two hours later we had our
                results, and I knew that A.I could speed up the process, while
                reducing the amount of human resources needed by a large amount.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took many days full of programming, late nights, and early
                mornings, but I managed to complete it in just few months. So
                hopefully you can enjoy much more relaxed tabulation, along
                with knowing that the tech that went into this system may one
                day take over the world ;)
