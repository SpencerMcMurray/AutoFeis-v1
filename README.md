# AutoFeis

A Python 3 Flask-based website. AutoFeis manages the creation, registration,
and tabulation of Irish Dance competitions, it also allows for creators to
manage their competition.

Our distinguishing factor is tabulation. We use a neural network
to provide very fast tabulation of results from competitions with handwritten marks
such as Irish Dancing competitions, however it could most likely be applied to other
similarly judged competitive events as well quite easily.
